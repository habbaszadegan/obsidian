Dear Parent,

So, on the issue of helping your child transition between activities, let's start by talking about the ideal scenario. We have a child who is doing well, having a good day, just going through what they have to do and what they like. It's a regular, happy day. When we're talking about transitions, we're trying to make sure that the child can completely latch off from what they're currently doing and be in a state where they can latch onto the next thing. And a lot of times, when the child is happy and doing okay, it can just be as simple as, "Hey, we're going to start having dinner," and they happily switch over. And that'll be that.

But what's more likely is that we're going to experience those average, regular days. That means not absolutely everything has been exciting and happy. Maybe the child is distracted, and transitioning is kind of tough. Grabbing their attention can be a chore in and of itself. They're into whatever they're doing—maybe it's coloring, running around—and they don't really want to move on to the next thing. They're not outright fighting you, but they're clearly not feeling the transition. And in these cases, it's important for the parent to acknowledge what's going on. If the child can’t bridge that gap between activities on their own, then the parent can give small reminders, some cues, some visual nudges to help bring their attention back to where they are and what’s coming next. We'll be talking about what these tools and techniques can look like.

And then, of course, we have days where things are just not going well at all. The child is unhappy, they're having a really tough time. When it's time to transition activities, you might get refusal, a meltdown, a tantrum, or a whole pattern of noncompliance. In these moments, it is so, so important that we maintain our own calm. That we come from a place of understanding instead of frustration. This is when our children need us the most. The world is new to them. They're dealing with things they’ve never dealt with before—emotions, sensory input, expectations—and they’re just defaulting to whatever their basic coping is.

So we have to meet that with patience. With presence. And a deep belief that we can be the calm in the storm.

With this in mind, we’re going to start our deep dive into what it looks like to help our children with transitions. How to assess the situation, assess our child, and assess ourselves. We’ll imagine what an ideal plan might look like. Then, we’ll explore how to carry out that plan in a real-world environment that’s often chaotic and messy.

We’ll also go through tools and techniques that we can prepare and practice. Things we can have ready to help make these moments easier. And we’ll remind ourselves that every day is different. New situations will come up. We’ll need to stay flexible and connected to what our child is showing us. That’s where the real work happens.

I hope this guide gives you insight, encouragement, and clarity.

Warmly, Hossein Abbaszadegan

So, on the issue of helping your child transition between activities. So, let's talk about the ideal scenario. First, we have a child who is doing well, having a good day, just going through, you know, what they have to do, and what is fun for them, and what they like, and it's just a normal, regular day. When we're talking about transitions, we're trying to make sure that the child can completely latch off from what they're currently doing, and just be in a state where they can latch on to what the next thing is that they're going to be doing. And a lot of times, when the child is just happy and doing okay, and having a good time, it can just be as simple as, you know, hey, we're going to start having dinner, and they will just, you know, happily switch over, and that'll be that.  
Now, what's more likely that we're going to experience is are days that are just kind of normal and average, and that means that you know, I mean, not absolutely everything has been exciting and happy, and so the child has there's a possibility of some difficulties, and let's say that, like, in this scenario where, I mean, things are kind of average like a child is, like, either distracted and transitioning is kind of, and like, grabbing their attention can be a chore in and of itself for the parent. The child can kind of just be really into whatever it is they're doing, if it's coloring or physical activity and running and or something like that, and they don't really want to be moving on to the next thing. It's not that they're outright fighting the parent, but they clearly are just not really wanting to complete the transition, and in these scenarios it's kind of important for, well, I mean, it's always important for a parent to be able to kind of just, like, acknowledge and see and in the case that the child is not able to bridge that gap between activities by themselves super well, the parent can start giving some small reminders, some cues, some visual cues they can help kind of bring that attention bring that focus back onto where they are and what is going to be coming next, and we'll be discussing what these, what some solutions and tools and techniques can be to accomplish this.  
And then we have days where things are just completely not going well. The child is not happy at all. They're having a very tough time. When asked to transition the activity, I mean, it's either refusal or a meltdown or tantrum, or just in general a pattern of noncompliance and lack of desire to transition to the next activity. And in these events, it's so, so, so important to be able to maintain our own calm, be able to come from a place of understanding instead of frustration, be the person who is going to be, and really just rely on the idea that this is where our children need us most. This is where the world is new to them. We have to develop the understanding that they're dealing with stuff that they've never dealt with before. Emotions, environmental stuff, and just really not knowing and really just defaulting to whatever their basic thing is. And so in these situations, we as caretakers need to, well, yeah, I think that's okay for now.  
So, with this in mind, we're going to start our deep dive into what it would look like to help our children with transitions into activities, how to assess the situation, assess the children, and assess ourselves. We're going to look at what it would look like to come up with a plan of action, something that in an ideal world it would look like, and then be able to execute that within a more realistic environment. And we're going to discuss some tools and techniques that we're going to be able to practice and have prepared and ready, as well as discuss and understand that with every day, new situations are going to pop up, and we are going to have to be flexible in what our child needs and how we're going to be able to approach every situation. As well as just generally some... Oh, yeah, I think that's pretty good.

## Title: Supporting Transitions & Calm Down Skills by Hossein Abbaszadegan

This guide helps with understanding your little one during activity transitions, and how to help them keep their calm.  

[[Introduction for Parents]]

Dear Parent,

So, on the issue of helping your child transition between activities, let's start by talking about the ideal scenario. We have a child who is doing well, having a good day, just going through what they have to do and what they like. It's a regular, happy day. When we're talking about transitions, we're trying to make sure that the child can completely latch off from what they're currently doing and be in a state where they can latch onto the next thing. And a lot of times, when the child is happy and doing okay, it can just be as simple as, "Hey, we're going to start having dinner," and they happily switch over. And that'll be that.

But what's more likely is that we're going to experience those average, regular days. That means not absolutely everything has been exciting and happy. Maybe the child is distracted, and transitioning is kind of tough. Grabbing their attention can be a chore in and of itself. They're into whatever they're doing—maybe it's coloring, running around—and they don't really want to move on to the next thing. They're not outright fighting you, but they're clearly not feeling the transition. And in these cases, it's important for the parent to acknowledge what's going on. If the child can’t bridge that gap between activities on their own, then the parent can give small reminders, some cues, some visual nudges to help bring their attention back to where they are and what’s coming next. We'll be talking about what these tools and techniques can look like.

And then, of course, we have days where things are just not going well at all. The child is unhappy, they're having a really tough time. When it's time to transition activities, you might get refusal, a meltdown, a tantrum, or a whole pattern of noncompliance. In these moments, it is so, so important that we maintain our own calm. That we come from a place of understanding instead of frustration. This is when our children need us the most. The world is new to them. They're dealing with things they’ve never dealt with before—emotions, sensory input, expectations—and they’re just defaulting to whatever their basic coping is.

So we have to meet that with patience. With presence. And a deep belief that we can be the calm in the storm.

With this in mind, we’re going to start our deep dive into what it looks like to help our children with transitions. How to assess the situation, assess our child, and assess ourselves. We’ll imagine what an ideal plan might look like. Then, we’ll explore how to carry out that plan in a real-world environment that’s often chaotic and messy.

We’ll also go through tools and techniques that we can prepare and practice. Things we can have ready to help make these moments easier. And we’ll remind ourselves that every day is different. New situations will come up. We’ll need to stay flexible and connected to what our child is showing us. That’s where the real work happens.

I hope this guide gives you insight, encouragement, and clarity.

Warmly, Hossein Abbaszadegan

## Understanding the Behavior

Lets further breakdown why kids have a hard time with transitioning activities. These can be due to the kiddo:  
- having a hard time regulating focus  
- anxiety  
- challenges with changing the routine  
- body discomfort (hungry, too hot, itchy bug bites)  
- and a number of other reasons.  
The first item when helping with transitioning activities is understanding what specific reason is what _your_ kid is experiencing. This involves slowing down your own pace, getting down to the childs eye level, and actively working to understand what they are experiencing in the moment. This can be achieved by developing skills in ourselves related to better accessing our empathy. Some of these skills include active listening, showing curiosity in others experience, and challenging your biases.

Lets talk about one of the most common root causes for challenging behaviors related to transitions: stress and overload. This can happen because of the environment (too noisy, too hot, bloated tummy, over stimulation for a long duration, etc.) and can lead to almost instant meltdowns and tantrums. When the child is in the middle of experiencing this, they might be unable to form words to explain why they are having a hard time, and often questions like “What do you need?” often have a backfiring effect since not only do they not know exactly what they need, the pressure caused by the expectation of explaining their need to the person asking it causes them to further spiral down into their tantrum / meltdown.

## What can we do about it?

First thing we can do is take a deep breath. If we're anticipating problems with an upcoming transition, we need to keep our own cool going in.
Next step is to acknowledge we're anticipating it. That's great news! This means we can *plan* around it. Generally speaking, its a good idea to always follow a set plan for transitions (makes it easier for everyone involved to expect a routine). Once that's been established, we can target the anticipated behavior and employ different tactics to get the kiddo to transition gently and successfully.
NOTE: remember the rule: "Less is More". Keep your conversation concise and to the point when doing the following steps.

### Step 1: Connect

Try to connect with them before starting the transition process. Look them in the eyes. Call out their name or express your presence in a sing-song voice. Merely show yourself physically and make it clear you are looking for their attention

### Step 2: Announce the upcoming transition

Now that you've attempted connection, in a playful and inviting manner announce the transition about to take place in the next few minutes. Advance notice is very important as it creates room for the kiddos attention to switch from the current task to the next one.
## Tools & Techniques  

When confronted with these situations the following steps is how to reach a better outcome with the transition:

1. Understand the root problem of what is causing the challenging environment for the child.
2. Assess the needs of the situation.
3. Create the best plan of action.
4. Execute that vision within the most reasonable parameters.

There’s some tried and true techniques we can use to help the child with transitions as well:

1. Singing about the transitioning activities. It’s nice to learn some songs to have ready related to transitioning, but often its best to use a sing-song voice to describe what is happening in the moment and what we will be moving on to. Key things to note about this technique is that it is helpful to announce the transition first, and to also keep singing and playing a little bit into the new activity until they have latched onto the new activity.
2. If following a set daily routine, having a visual system (e.g. calendar, transition cards) set up with completion stars and reward doodles can be excellent. This helps manage the childs expectations, it helps in creating advance warnings, and can teach the child to follow structure

## Practice Plan

Lets bring all this into practice:

1. Assess the child and their likely response to the transition and follow up activity. Are they well fed? Are they experiencing any Big Emotions? Have they had their fill of the current activity? How do they feel about the following activity?
2. After addressing any needs they might have, engage them in some sing song conversation about what is going to come next
3. Ease them into the next activity by staying lively and playful

In the event they are not handling the transition well:

1. Get on their eye level and connect with them. Try to put yourself in their shoes and see what they are struggling with. Avoid asking too many questions of them, and instead slowly convey what the expectation is that is being asked of them. Often its enough for them to feel the connection to move on to the next item

## Things to Avoid for Successful Transitions

1. Fast transitions are hard for a reason: switching focus can cost energy resources. If there’s not enough time to complete an activity to the childs satisfaction then it would be helpful to plan around easing the transition in other ways

Ray is playing Tag with his classmates and is asked to start the next activity, which is coloring. At first, he visually seems to comply with the request, but midway to stopping his game and starting the coloring activity he gets upset. After a few minutes he has completely stopped following instructions and is hardrooted to where he is standing, visibly becoming more upset by the moment. He ultimately lets out a sound halfway between crying and a shout of anger and won’t listen to any amount of reasoning the teacher communicates with him.  
Ray has experienced an inability to switch focus from the first task to the next one. He feels like he didn’t get the opportunity to finish his game and is upset that the task is over so soon. Had he been given some warning
